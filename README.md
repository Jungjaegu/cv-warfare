# cv-warfare
Keyword-stuff your CV to bypass automated CV screeners

# why?
Remember the good old days of the web, when you could put keywords at the bottom of your website (white text on white background) as valid SEO? *cv-warfare* applies those tactics against automated CV screeners. This script will automagically add buzzwords in white text to the bottom of your CV.

# examples
The repository contains 2 sample PDFs:
[sample-input.pdf](sample-input.pdf) - a sample CV
[sample-output.pdf](sample-output.pdf) - a sample CV

# usage
Ensure that your CV is named input.pdf

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
